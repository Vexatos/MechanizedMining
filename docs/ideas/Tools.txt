Work our way up from wood to steel. Creating more basic tools, and some advanced ones

Sets
    *Note Pick-Ax, Ax, Shovel, Hoe will be created by the core as metadata items. Then enabled by each mod that needs them. That way this mod and farm tech can share the same content. 
   
   
   Pick-Ax - The basics are always needed
   Drill - electric and fuel based tool to mine at a high rate. We need to later add a 3D render and animation for this
   Laser Miner - Mining with a laser is a must :)
   
   Hole Drill - used to drill holes for TNT charges.
   TNT charge - Small charge of tnt, yes there will be better types, that is used to blow up rock in a large area.
   TNT wiring - wiring for tnt though redstone can be used too. Is made of string and coper though you get a stack per recipe
   TNT Delay - delays the fuse by a second or two. This will later come in handy for special demo jobs.
   TNT Plunger - Classic style is to live for. Wooden box with a twist style plunger to set off tnt.
