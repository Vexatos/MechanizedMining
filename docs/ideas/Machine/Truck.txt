I'm looking to add vechicals too all the mods in the near future. For the mining mod we need to add a small work truck(not a pickup) that the player will have a double chest to store items with and can drive around. On the outside it should have slots for tools, and a solar panel upgrade option to charge the tools. It should be very fast and very useful. A battery and fuel version should be offered.

Render should be simple though the player should not render normally. Instead the vehicel should de-render the player and render the player seated correctly. This way we don't have to worry about the player's body parts moving around or sticking out of the model. As well the texture for the model should be a faded constrution orange. The vehicle should only have one seat for the player and a single head light. Doors should open and shut when the player access the vehicle. The back should have 4 doors that are connected to small chests. Each chest will have 1/4 a chests inventory adding up to 2 chests in total.
