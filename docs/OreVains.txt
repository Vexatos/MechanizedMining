We could later on add a system to override mod ores. Then generate very large vains of ore that will cause player to look for them. Instead of getting small pockets of ore a player could find a 1K long span of ore. This will keep them mining for a while. As well SMP will make a reason to build mining sites and fight over land. 

Another part of this will be bedrock mines. In which a mine can be built that will dig down to bed rock and pertend that there is land under bedrock. This can be used as a long term mining output at a slow pace. Eg 20 bars an hour comparted to a player getting 100 an hour. Deminson support can be added to this simulating an actual cave world that is being mined. I was planning on adding this to my NPC mod but we can develope it out here first. As well don't confuse this will infite mining as sites will go dry. A map will be created that will log vains of ore under the bedrock. It will say how many blocks and the size of the vain. In which the player will get his ore as long as the vain is still there. After a while the vain will run out, though it could take weeks.
